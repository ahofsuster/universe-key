							<p>This question asked so often suggests that there is actually a plausible answer. Almost as if my being were a fixed thing. People who ask this sort of question are typically struggling with their identity and are searching for a core sense of themselves. The irony is that the more you seek to identify who you are, the more fragile you are likely to feel about yourself.</p>

							<p>Imagine that you've been in prison for twenty years, incarcerated since the age of eighteen. You literally have no adult life experience outside of the penitentiary. Your sense of self is tragically limited.</p>

							<p>I hardly know, just at present at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.</p>
